So this is my second project in sfml. It is based on a simple nokia car game. You control a car by four arrow keys.
The opposing vehicles' speed increases with time.
The game saves your highest five scores in the 3 difficulty modes.
The 3 difficulty modes easy,medium and hard differ in the initial speed of opposing vehicles as well as the increment in their speed with time.
Currently I'm trying to adjust the different speeds and increments of the 3 opposing vehicles(car,truck and van) to make sure nothing is exploitable.
If you can help me improve this code thank you very much.
